config FLASH_TRAINING_PRIORITY
	int "Flash training priority"
	default 85
	help
	  Initialization priority for flash training. This is used to train the
	  SSI RX DELAY value for the best reliability. Must be greater than
	  flash and MSPI init priority

config FLASH_RESET_PRIORITY
	int "Flash reset priority"
	default 75
	help
	  Initialization priority for flash reset. This is used to reset the flash
	  before the flash driver runs. Must be greater than MSPI init priority,
	  and less than flash init priority.

	default y
	help
	  It's safe to enable this option always, but it is mainly required when using JTAG to control
	  Blackhole cards. It requires both a JTAG debugger attached to the SMC as well as an SWD
	  debugger attached to the DMC.

	  This is the address of the GPIO control register on the DMC that controls the SRST pin(s).
